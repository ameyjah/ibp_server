Building ibp_server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For building you need the following packages installed:

  -Apache Portable Runtime Toolkit
  -Apache Portable Runtime Utilities Toolkit
  -Berkeley DB
  -Google Protocol Buffers and also the protoc-c 3rd party
   compiler for native C support
  -OpenSSL
  -cmake

and optionally Phoebus for TCP overlay transfers.

To build the IBP_server you should be able to unpack the tarball and then modify
bootstrap as needed.  bootstrap is a wrapper that runs cmake to generate the Makefiles.
You can then run 'make' to build the executables....

git clone https://github.com/datalogistics/ibp_server.git
cd ibp_server
./bootstrap
make

Adding resources
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each drive this server will use needs to be mounted and added to the server
configuration to be used. In order to do that:

./mkfs.resource <IBP id (unique)> dir <path to drive> <path to drive DB> <maximum size in MB>

Where:
    IBP id needs to be unique per server
    path to drive is the absolute path to the storage
    path to drive DB is the absolute path to the directory storing the resource DB
        -- This can be on a separate disk, possibly SSD
    If the maximum size is omitted, the default is to have no limit

Will provide the on-disk files needed. The output from mkfs.resource should then
be copy/pasted into the /etc/ibp.cfg to inform IBP of the additional resources
available after restart.

Starting the service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An init script is provided and will be installed as "ibp_server"

Monitoring the service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To verify the IBP server is operating and accepting connections, one can use

get_version -a

or

get_version <host> <port>

If the server is active, it will dump the current status, otherwise there will
be an error.

IBP configuration options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[server] options
-------------------------------
interfaces=host1:port1;host2:port2;
  You can have as many host/port combinations as you want.  If interfaces is
  not used then it defaults to using the hostname.

port=my_port
  Default port to use.  Only used if interfaces is missing.  Default is 6714.

password=my_password
  Default is ibp.  The password is in clear text in the file and transfered over the wire
  so be warned.  It's really only used for a few calls that I don't classify as insecure.
  The depot doesn't support the ability to change RID's or settings remotely.

lazy_allocate=[0|1]
  Don't allocate space upon creation just when it is used.  The default is 1.  Setting to 0
  is discouraged.

threads=N
  Max number of threads or connections to allow.  I tend to make it 2-4 times the number of RID's

max_pending=N
  Max number of pending connections. Default is 8.

max_network_wait_ms=N
  Max amount of time in ms allowed to read a command before the connection is closed.

timestamp_interval=N
  Log file timestamp interval in sec. Default is 60 sec.

min_idle=N
  Min idle connection time in secs *between commands* before closing a connection.
  Default is 30 sec.

backoff_scale=N
  Scale factor for calculating backoff time when the max number of incoming connections is reached.
  The backoff time, in secs, that's returned is MIN(backoff_max, MAX(1,reject_count*backoff_scale)).
  reject_count is a tally of rejected connections without success. As soon as a connection is
  accepted reject_count is reset to 0.

backoff_max=N
  Max time, in secs, to wait before a retry.  Sent to the client.

big_alloc_enable=[0|1]
  Allow 2GB or greater allocations if set to 1.

splice_enable=[0|1]
  Attempt to use splice if set to 1 for data transfers.  This may be overriden if the OS
  doesn't support it.  ALso this setting is ignored if disk chksums are required for the operation.

log_file=output_file
  Where to store the log output.  If output file is "stdout" or "stderr" then the
  output is redirected to those devices.  Otherwise it goes tothe file.

log_maxsize=N
   Max size of the log file in MB before it gets recycled.

log_level=N
   Controls verbosity of output with 0 being minimal and 20 being everything.

debug_level=N
   Similar to log_level and should be removed.

db_env_loc=my_env
   Where to store the RID DB environment files.  If set to "local" then each RID
   keeps it's own DB environment.  This is the default.

db_mem=N
   Amount of memory to use for the DB cache.  Default is 256MB.  If db_env_loc=local
   this should be much smaller, say 16MB.

activity_file=my_activity_log
   Where to store the activity log.  This is a compressed log of all IBP commands
   the depot attempts to execute.  You can use print_alog to replay these log files.

activity_maxsize=N
   Max size of each activity file in MB.

activity_max_history=N
   Number of old activity files to keep.  The default is 1.

activity_host=host
   Hostname or IP address of where to send the activity logs to.  IF not declared then
   the logs are deleted based on activity_max_history.

activity_port=port
   Port on host to send the logs.

force_resource_rebuild=N
   Only used in case of an emergency to do a file system walk to rebuild the RID DBes.
   The default value is 0 and if set to 2 a complete rebuild is done.  A value of 1
   used to have a meaning and shouldn't be used.....Oops.

truncate_duration=N
   This is useful if you shorten the depots max duration.  If set to 1 and
   force_resource_rebuild=2 then the depot rebuilds DBes and truncates any
   allocations with excessive durations.

soft_fail=[0|1]
   Controls how a client connection is handled when encountering an IBP error.  The default,
   soft_fail=0, is to always close the client connection on any error.  If soft_fail=1 then
   for most errors the client connection is not terminated.  It is always terminated on malformed
   commands.

return_cap_id=[0|1]
   The default method, 0, is to return a dummy argument for the typekey since the depot doesn't use it.
   if 1 the allocation's file name, id, is returned.  This facilitates debugging but is less secure.

[phoebus] options
-------------------------------
gateway=phoebus_host1/port1,phoebus_host2/port2,....
   This is the default Phoebus path to use.
   Must be specified (even if not enabled) and points to the default Phoebus host.
   Can be filled with anything if not enabled.  This parameter is pased directly to phoebus
   and is the reason for using "/" and "," notation which is different for other parameters.


[access_control] options
-------------------------------
These options control access to each individual IBP command.  They all take
an access control list argument which is a collection of ACL's each ACL can have the form:
   host
   ip_address
   host/bit_mask
   ip_address/bit_mask

Multiple ACL's are separated by a ";".  Specify "open" to leave the command unfiltered.
Local access can be granted using the keyword "local".

------------------------------

default=ACL
   This is the default ACLs to use for any command NOT specified.  The default is "open".
   All chksum command ACLs are covered by the non-chksum versions

ibp_allocate=ACL
ibp_split_allocate=ACL
ibp_merge_allocate=ACL
ibp_status=ACL
ibp_manage=ACL
ibp_write=ACL
ibp_store=ACL
ibp_load=ACL
ibp_send=ACL
ibp_phoebus_send=ACL
ibp_rename=ACL
ibp_alias_allocate=ACL
ibp_alias_manage=ACL
ibp_push=ACL
ibp_pull=ACL
internal_get_config=ACL
internal_get_alloc=ACL
internal_get_corrupt=ACL
internal_date_free=ACL
internal_expire_list=ACL
internal_undelete=ACL
internal_rescan=ACL
internal_ibp_mount=ACL
internal_ibp_umount=ACL

RID options
-------------------------------
Each Resource is defined by 2 sections -- [resource RID] and [db RID] -- where
RID is the resource ID.
-------------------------------

[resource RID] options
-------------------------------
rid=my_rid
   This should match the RID in the section.  It's redundant and should be removed.

mode=[read, write, manage]
   Comma seperated list of access modes. The default mode is to enable full access.
   The most common usage is when a drive is failing and you mark it as read-only while the
   data is being copied/repaired.

cache_expire=N
   How long, in seconds, to cache block level chksums when doing read operations.  If the same allocation
   block is accessed within this timeframe the full block is not re-read to validate the chksum.  It is assumed to be
   good and just the data requested is accessed.  The default is 30 sec.

n_cache=N
   Number of allocation block chksums to cache.  The default is 100,00.

max_duration=N
   Max allocation duration in sec.

resource_type=dir
   Type of resource.  Currently the only option is "dir" for a directory resource.

device=/resource/path
   Directory to use for storing data

update_alloc=[0|1]
   Update each allocation header in addition to it's DB entry if set to 1. Default is 1.

enable_read_history=[0|1]
   Keep a log of the last 16 read commands on the allocation if set to 1.

enable_write_history=[0|1]
   Keep a log of the last 16 write commands on the allocation if set to 1.

enable_manage_history=[0|1]
   Keep a log of the last 16 manage commands on the allocation if set to 1.

enable_alias_history=[0|1]
   Keep a log of the last 16 alias operations on the allocation if set to 1.

cleanup_interval=N
   Cleanup thread interval in sec.  Default is 600 sec.  This controls how often
   the check for expired data is run.  Any expired data is then moved to the
   expired recycle bin.  After the expire check runs the thread then looks for any recycle
   bin data that has exhausted it's grace period and physically removes it.

rescan_interval=N
   How often the recycle bins are inventoried.  At any point a person can change
   in the the trash directories and manually remove files.  When this occurs
   the amount of space in the recycle bins differs from what the depot thinks
   is their.  In this case the recycle directories should be rescanned using the
   ibp_rescan tool.

delete_grace_period=N
   Amount of time a deleted allocation stays in the deleted recycle bin before
   being purged.

expire_grace_period=N
   Amount of time a deleted allocation stays in the deleted recycle bin before
   being purged.

preexpire_grace_period=N
   Extra time in secs an expired allocation can be used before it is moved to the
   expired recycle bin.  This is really intended to give an application a brief
   window to easily recover an expired allocation before it's moved to the recycle
   bin where it's much more complicated to recover.

max_size=N
   Max amount of disk space to use in MB.

soft_size=N
   Max amount of space to use for "soft" allocations in MB.

hard_size=N
   Max amount of space to use for "hard" allocations in MB.

minfree_size=N
   Minimum amount of free space to leave on the device in MB.

preallocate=[0|1]
   Preallocate allocation space if 1.  This writes 0's to the allocation guaranteeing
   the space.  The default is 0.  This will greatly reduces performance and is discouraged.
